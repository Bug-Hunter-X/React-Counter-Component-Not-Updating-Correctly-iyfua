This React component uses the `useState` hook to manage a counter. However, the counter is not updated correctly when the increment button is clicked. The issue is that the `setCount` function is not called with the updated value of `count`. Instead, it is called with the original value of `count` which is 0. This causes the counter to always display 0, regardless of how many times the increment button is clicked.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count); // Issue: setCount is not called with the updated count
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
